        <p>This fan page is created because I am an absolute lover of Dragon
          Ball Z since I was a kid. Goku, being my favorite. However, the main
        purpose of this page is to help me practice my HTML and CSS skills since
      I am currently studying full stack web developement. So, please enjoy!</p>

      <p style="padding: 10px;">Goku was born on Planet Vegeta, long story short, they determined
      that he was too weak but the Saiyans still wanted to get their use out
    of him so they sent him to Earth to conquer the planet as a baby. However,
  when his pod landed on earth it he managed to hit his head in the process. This
caused Goku to have amnesia. Due to that reason alone, it re-worked his entire
thought process and allowed him to become what we know today through rigorous
training with a multitude of different masters. Grandpa Gohan, Master Roshi,
King Kai and the list goes on.</p>

      <p style="padding: 10px;">He not only got trained by some of the top masters around the universe
      he also had the opportunity and duty to upkeep Earths protection. In doing
    so, he has fought infamous people that were known to bring destruction or
  potentially going to bring destruction. To name a few major ones, he fought
Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu. There are a multitude of others he fought but those
mentioned are some of the key players in Dragon Ball Z that he fought in order to
protect Earth.</p>

      <p style="padding: 10px;">Now, some more major things that Goku achieved would be the numerous
      transformations that we've seen him reach. With these transformations came
    a new height in power for him which allowed him to continue his journey
  to protect earth. If you want a more detailed history I'd recommend that you
check out this <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Goku">link</a>. Below you will find information regarding the transformations
that he achieved.</p>
