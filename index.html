        <p>This fan page is created because I am an absolute lover of Dragon
          Ball Z since I was a kid. Goku, being my favorite. However, the main
        purpose of this page is to help me practice my HTML and CSS skills since
      I am currently studying full stack web developement. So, please enjoy!</p>

      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p style="padding: 10px;">Goku was born on Planet Vegeta, long story short, they determined
      that he was too weak but the Saiyans still wanted to get their use out
    of him so they sent him to Earth to conquer the planet as a baby. However,
  when his pod landed on earth it he managed to hit his head in the process. This
caused Goku to have amnesia. Due to that reason alone, it re-worked his entire
thought process and allowed him to become what we know today through rigorous
training with a multitude of different masters. Grandpa Gohan, Master Roshi,
King Kai and the list goes on.</p>

      <p style="padding: 10px;">He not only got trained by some of the top masters around the universe
      he also had the opportunity and duty to upkeep Earths protection. In doing
    so, he has fought infamous people that were known to bring destruction or
  potentially going to bring destruction. To name a few major ones, he fought
Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu. There are a multitude of others he fought but those
mentioned are some of the key players in Dragon Ball Z that he fought in order to
protect Earth.</p>

      <p style="padding: 10px;">Now, some more major things that Goku achieved would be the numerous
      transformations that we've seen him reach. With these transformations came
    a new height in power for him which allowed him to continue his journey
  to protect earth. If you want a more detailed history I'd recommend that you
check out this <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Goku">link</a>. Below you will find information regarding the transformations
that he achieved.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="ss1-desc">
      <p style="margin: 0 0 0 5px;">This is Goku's first transformation that he achieves in the DBZ series.
      It is called Super Saiyan 1. This form comes with <span style="colo: gold;">golden hair</span>,
    and a <span style="color: gold;">golden aura</span>. His eyes turn <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>
  and his hair becomes spiky. Overall, his power and speed increases and in doing
so he was able to defeat Frieza using this form.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ss2">
      <!--Blank Space For Container-->
    </div>
    <div class="ss2-img">

    </div>
    <div class="ss2-desc">
      <p style="margin: 0 0 0 5px;">This is Goku's second transformation. In this form, his hair becomes
      even spikier and it also seems as if he has grown more hair. His eyes stay
    <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> and his hair and aura stay
  <span style="color: gold;">gold</span>. Aesthetically, the largest change would
be the fact that he now has lightning that arcs around his body. He used this form
to attemp to defeat Majin Vegeta, but loses.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ss3">
      <!--Blank Space For Container-->

    <div class="ss3-img">

    </div>
    <div class="ss3-desc">
      <p style="margin: 0 0 0 5px;">This is Goku's third and final transformation
      that we see in Dragon Ball Z. This is, by far, the most powerful of his
    transformations and by a long shot. Again, as before, he continues to have
  his <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> eyes and <span style="color: gold;">gold</span>
hair. However, his hair is now down to the back of his knees. He uses this form
to fight Majin Buu at one point in the DBZ series.</p>
